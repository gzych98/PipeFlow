# PipeFlow

In almost every technological process there is a flow of some medium and the amount of flow and its parameters affect the correctness of the process. Calculation of the velocity of fluid flow through a pipeline is one of the tasks of fluid mechanics and boils down to the determination of the average value for a specific cross-sectional diameter using the pile-up tubes, anemometers and thermoanemometers
